1. Factories
the strategic warehouse location for a given set of factory points using the kd-tree and Weiszfeld's algorithm with adaptive step sizes. The time complexity of the code is O(n log n), where n is the number of factory points.


2. Session id
    the optimized implementation achieves constant-time complexity (O(1)) for both generating unique session IDs and releasing them. The amortized complexity of expanding the bit vector during getUniqueSessionID() is also O(1) due to the doubling strategy. This makes the solution highly efficient for handling millions of users concurrently while minimizing memory usage.


3. validjson
  O(n + m), where n is the number of characters in the input JSON string, and m is the number of elements in the JSON data structure.


4. apicall
    the rate-limiting mechanism's time complexity mainly depends on the number of API calls made (in the test function) and the actual API call implementation. The token bucket management (refilling and taking tokens) has a constant time complexity (O(1)) and does not significantly impact the overall performance of the rate-limiting mechanism.
